#Veldspar Assets
This repository contains verious graphical assets used by the [Veldspar](https://github.com/jluchiji/veldspar) project.
This project itself is licensed under terms on the MIT License. However, since most images are traced from bitmap icons extracted from Eve Online client, I do now own their design. For terms of using them please consult the [Eve Online community toolkit](http://community.eveonline.com/community/fansites/toolkit/) terms and conditions.

Some of images come from the [ionicons](http://ionicons.com) project.
